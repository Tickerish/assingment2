                   Miss Emma Macdonald - Mediator Personality (INFP, -A/ -T)

                      Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration. Now for the next test the vark questioneer I got a miltimodal learning preference. For big 5 test, I was labelled as being high in agreeableness, coscientiousness and intellect/imagination but I was graded low on extroversion and emotional stability. These results added all together mean that I am a person who is highly open to trying new things and acknowleding everyone in a group. I can be a leader if the need is there but if someone else takes up that mantel then I would be one to let them do so. The way that these results may influence my behaviour in the team, is I would like to think I would be a very approachable individual, though I can be heavy handed when I need to be.

                    The Advocate personality type is very rare, making up less than one percent of the population, but they nonetheless leave their mark on the world. Advocates have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is that they are not idle dreamers. These individuals are capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact. For the Vaark test, Mrs Kerri Schmidt is an Auditory learning. This means that Mrs Kerri will be more enticed to participate in group conversations and she takes charge. Mrs Kerri scored high on four areas on the big 5 test. These are openness, Conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness. Which is a very good mixture. She will be Aventurous, creative and intellectual. She will forego shortterm gratification for the sake of long term achievements and she will be very outgoing and confident. She is also a person who will put the needs of others before her own and her compassion and empathy is quite high. The knowledge of these results will influence her in a positive way for a team exercise. Rather than finding the need to do more she will rely more on her team to produce a joint effort. She will endeavour to learn more trust in her teammates with knowledge that they are driving for the same level of perfection with the drive to achieve high distinctions, like herself. She is typically a person that likes to take charge when she is confident in her knowledge and abilities. IT is a weak area for her so she will take more direction from other team members and ask more questions to further cement her understanding. With techniques on how to improve her learning style she will do more activities that suit her learning style, such as group discussions.

                    The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are. For the learning style test he got the same as Mrs Kerri Schmidt, this being Auditory. For the big 5 personality test, he scored big in conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism, whilst scoring 52% in openness and scoring low in extraversion. This means he can help plan out tasks for the group, he will be on time with his components of the work we are doing, and he will always check with my team before making a notable change. It is important for his team to know these test results as they may help understand how he approach certain situations within a group project.

                    People who share the Consul personality type are, for lack of a better word, popular – which makes sense, given that it is also a very common personality type, making up twelve percent of the population. In high school, Consuls are the cheerleaders and the quarterbacks, setting the tone, taking the spotlight and leading their teams forward to victory and fame. Later in life, Consuls continue to enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy. In the Chegg-type-learner-quiz, he was diagnosed as a visual learner. This means he is far more suited to having information presented in observable ways. He likes to picture concepts in his head and see what he is learning. He takes detailed notes and needs a quite study space. For the big 5 personality test, he scored high in 4 categories. These being Extraversion, agreeableness, Conscientiousness and openness. Whilst scoring low on Neutoricism. This means he will try to encourage esteem, empathy and trust among members.
